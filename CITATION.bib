  abstract={This paper introduces Benchmark Profiling, a mechanistic interpretability method that identifies and analyzes the specific neural network regions responsible for different cognitive abilities in large language models. By selectively damaging or amplifying these regions, we provide insights into how LLMs solve different types of reasoning problems and understand cross-benchmark relationships.}
